GUI is functional
    [x]- search works properly, though questionable
    [x]- Query results panel need to be expanded (width is too tight)

Database appears fully functional
    [x]- redesign the code structure - currently unicode, needs to be text
    [x]- option menus are not operating properly
    - need to implement 'save function'

Need to connect front to back.
    [x]- Dynamic SQL queries
      [x] - food group and name successful, but not yet with nutrients
    [x]- 'Search' button needs to interact directly with listbox, entry, and optionmenu
    [x]- Sort by nutrients, how to use more than 1?

get a list of names and id numbers based on criteria
    for each name/id, create an array

        search the db for nutrient values and units where their food id is the searched id.

            SELECT NUTNAME,AMT_PER_SERVING,UNIT
            FROM NUTRIENTS AS N
            JOIN FOODS AS F ON N.NDBNO = F.NDBNO
            WHERE NDBNO LIKE 'NDBNO'

            for each tuple returned, string all together and append to array using the ndbno

    print out each array on the list box.
