Overview:

This program uses the data retrieved from an API call on the USDA no SQL database and sifts through it by user input.
The main interface is a graphical search interface that will accept a range of input, then runs back-end SQL queries.

This is a successful version of the Skeleton design, in that it can only query the data, but not save it or compare it.
The overall goal of this program was to simply ensure a query engine that functioned through dynamic queries. In that
manner, this project has been a success.

Note:

Running an API call to set up the database draws some unusual values. Fruit and Beer tend to get too much attention in
these calls. Future development should take the values from the downloadable ASCII files instead of direct calls.
